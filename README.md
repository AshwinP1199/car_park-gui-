Car Parking System GUI Features

1. Display Parking Status:
Clicking the "Display Parking Status" button allows users to view the current status of all parking slots.
Occupied slots are marked in red, while available slots are marked in green.
Users can interact with the "Display Parking Status" feature to perform the following actions:

Park a Car:
To park a car, click on an available parking slot.
A dialog will open, requesting information about the car to be parked:
Car Make
Car Model
Car Year
License Plate
The system validates the license plate and slot availability before parking the car.
Real-time updates on parking slot status make it easy to identify available slots.

Delete a Parking Slot:
To delete a parking slot, click on the slot to be removed.
A confirmation dialog will appear to confirm the deletion of the slot.
Deleted slots are no longer available for parking cars, streamlining the management of parking resources.

Remove a Car by Slot:
To remove a car from an occupied slot, click on the occupied slot.
A dialog will open, confirming the removal of the car from the slot.
Removing a car from a slot frees up the slot for another vehicle.

2. Remove Car by License Plate:
Outside the "Display Parking Status," users can remove a car by entering its license plate number.
Click the "Remove Car" button and enter the license plate of the car to be removed.
Removing a car by license plate is a convenient option for car removal.

3. Find a Car:
Clicking the "Find Car" button opens a menu for searching for a parked car by specific criteria.
Users can choose to find a car by either:
Car Make: Enter the make of the car to view all cars of that make parked in the system.
License Plate: Enter the license plate to locate a specific car in the system.

4. Add Parking Slot:
Clicking the "Add Parking Slot" button opens a dialog for adding new parking slots to the system.
Users should enter a unique slot identifier (e.g., A001) to create a new parking slot.
